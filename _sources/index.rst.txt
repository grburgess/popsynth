   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to popsynth's documentation!
====================================
.. image:: ../external/logo.png

This framework provides an abstract way to generate survey populations from
arbitrary luminosity functions and redshift distributions. Additionally,
auxiliary quantities can be sampled and stored.

Populations can be saved and restored via an HDF5 files for later
use. Population synthesis routines can be created via classes or
structured YAML files.

Users can construct their own classes for spatial, luminosity,
etc. distributions which can all be connected to arbitrarily complex
selection functions.

.. note:: This is *not* Synth Pop. If you were expecting thatâ€¦ I suggest you check out Depeche Mode. Though, it is possible to combine coding and good music_.
