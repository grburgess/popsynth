# popsynth

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grburgess/popsynth/master/external/logo.png)

A simple object oreinted  population synthesis framework designed for testing population inference in Stan.
It has grown passed its orginal intent to be able to produce populations/catalogs from a variety of luminosity functions, redshift distributions, and even more abstractions. Documentation coming soon.
It also makes a lot of pretty pictures.

Note: **This is not synth pop!** If you were looking for some hard driving beats out of a yamaha keyboard with bells... look elsewhere
